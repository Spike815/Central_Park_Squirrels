# Central_Park_Squirrels
A python study project , in which I used pandas to analyze the data.
I have read about how grey color squirrels are invasive in certain regions. On the New York city data center I found the data about the squirrel distribution in the central park.https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw 
In this project I exacted the data of fur color. Not surprisingly, gray squirrels make up the majority!
